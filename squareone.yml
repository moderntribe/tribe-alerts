# SquareOne Project Docker Config
#

# giving values appropriate to this project for some of the configuration
# variables.
#
# Add variables here if the project requires a different value than the default
# provided by SquareOne Global Docker
#
# See https://github.com/moderntribe/square1-global-docker/blob/master/config/squareone.yml
# for the full list of variables that a project can override. Of particular interest
# are those values under `local-docker` and `tests`
